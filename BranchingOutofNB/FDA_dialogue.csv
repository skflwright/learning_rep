FDA Representative: Of course. What specifically are you concerned about?

"caller: I'm not sure what kind of mask to wear or if I need to wear one at all. Also, I'm hearing a lot about vaccines and I don't know which one to get or if they're safe."

"FDA Representative: Those are common questions. The CDC recommends wearing masks in certain situations, such as when you're in a public setting where it's difficult to maintain social distancing. As for vaccines, all the COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the US have undergone rigorous testing and have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA. They have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials."

caller: That's good to know. What about booster shots? Do I need one and when should I get it?

"FDA Representative: The CDC has recommended booster shots for certain groups of people who have already received the COVID-19 vaccine. They suggest getting a booster shot six months after your second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, or two months after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. You should consult with your healthcare provider to see if a booster shot is right for you."

"caller: Okay, thanks for the information. Is there anything else I should know to protect myself and my family from COVID-19?"

Additionally, using medications intended for animals, including aquarium fish, can be very dangerous and lead to serious harm, including death."
